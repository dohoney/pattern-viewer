# Pattern Viewer
This is a viewer for the quadrangulation patterns in the database provided with the publication

Patterns can be browsed by the number of sides and their id in the database. A simplified pattern is shown if further polychord collapses are possible for the original pattern. Polychord expansions are also demonstrated by changing the width of independent polychords.
